**** USE  / DO NOT USE  imagecache.module v1.1 ****

know Denial of Service holes. Use at your own risk.

docs for v1.1...
 requires clean urls working and enabled.

 in you theme files create a image url using 
 files/imagecache/<function>/<arg 1>/<arg 2>/<path to image>
 where function is in_array('scale','resize').
 path is the normal path to the image file.

 A an image will be generated dynamically, written to the filesystem, and delivered to the 
requesting browser. future requests for the same url will be caught by apaches rewrite rules
and served directly from the filesystem.

be warned this is a proof of concept and exposes your server to Denial Of Service attacks. 
You would be best to wait on the next version before taking this module to production...

**** ****** ****** ******* ***** ***
ImageCache is currently undergoing rapid development. I'm working on a new UI that will be more like the 
image.module for handling dynamic derivatives.
